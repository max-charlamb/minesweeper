# minesweeper
A python3 command line minesweeper implementation.

Due to how macOS handles input reading the program must be run as an administrator. This is not an issue on Windows. <br><br>

To run navigate to the directory and enter these commands:

Windows/Linux
```
python minesweeper.py
```

macOS
```
sudo python minesweeper.py
```
